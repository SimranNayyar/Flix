### App Walkthrough GIF
Hi, I was having some issues with the gif again, so I have also put a youtube link with the video once again, I am not sure what the issue is. I will be mentioning this to the TAs in tomorrow's session.

### Notes
The posters in my grid layout are very small and I am not sure what the issue is because I double checked my code with the video and it's the exact same. I also asked for help on the Slack and no one replied there either.

Hi, I was having some issues with the gif, before the link kept disappearing and now it's not moving so I have also put a youtube link with the video. I will try again later and hopefully it works then!
